# YuukiPS Launcher

A modern game launcher built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Tauri for cross-platform desktop functionality.

## Features

- üéÆ Modern game launcher interface
- üñ•Ô∏è Native desktop application with Tauri
- üéØ Windows-specific game launching functionality
- üìÅ Game folder management
- ‚öôÔ∏è Game settings and configuration
- üîÑ Real-time game installation status
- üé® Beautiful UI with Tailwind CSS
- üîí Administrator privilege enforcement for secure operations
- üåê Built-in proxy server functionality
- üîß Automatic game patching capabilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Administrator Requirements

**This launcher requires administrator privileges to function properly.**

The application needs admin access for:
- **Game Patching**: Copying and applying game patches to protected directories
- **Proxy Server**: Running the built-in proxy server on system ports
- **System Configuration**: Modifying Windows proxy settings when needed

### Installation
- The installer will automatically request administrator privileges
- Always install as administrator when prompted

### Running the Application
- The launcher will check for admin privileges at startup
- If not running as admin, the application will display an error and exit
- **Solution**: Right-click the launcher and select "Run as administrator"

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Rust (latest stable)
- Windows (for Windows-specific features)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run in development mode (web version):
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run Tauri development mode (desktop version):
```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

### Building

#### Quick Build

1. Build web version:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Build desktop application:
```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

#### Automated Builds

This project includes automated build workflows that create setup files for Windows and Linux:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automatically builds on push/PR and creates releases
- **Local Scripts**: Cross-platform build scripts for development

**Using build scripts:**

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\build.ps1

# Linux/macOS
./build.sh

# Development mode
.\build.ps1 -Dev     # Windows
./build.sh --dev    # Linux/macOS

# Clean build
.\build.ps1 -Clean  # Windows
./build.sh --clean  # Linux/macOS
```

**Creating releases:**

```bash
# Tag and push to trigger automated release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

For detailed build instructions, platform-specific setup, and troubleshooting, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Tauri Integration

The launcher includes the following Tauri commands for Windows functionality:

- `launch_game(game_id, game_title)` - Launch a game executable
- `show_game_folder(game_id)` - Open game folder in Windows Explorer
- `check_game_installed(game_id)` - Check if a game is installed

### Game Installation Detection

The launcher checks for games in the following directory structure:
```
C:\Games\{game_id}\game.exe
```

You can modify the game paths in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` to match your game installation directories.

## Features

### Desktop-Specific Features

- **Custom Window Controls**: Minimize, maximize, and close buttons
- **Window Dragging**: Drag the header to move the window
- **Game Launching**: Direct integration with Windows to launch game executables
- **Folder Management**: Open game folders in Windows Explorer
- **Installation Detection**: Automatically detect installed games

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

The launcher works both as a web application and as a native desktop application:

- Web version: Shows demo messages for desktop-specific features
- Desktop version: Full functionality with native Windows integration

## Configuration

### Tauri Configuration

The Tauri configuration is located in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Key settings:

- Window size: 1200x800 (minimum 1000x700)
- Decorations: Disabled (custom window controls)
- Transparency: Enabled for modern UI effects

### Game Data

Game information is stored in `src/data/games.ts`. Each game includes:

- Basic info (title, description, developer)
- Version and status information
- Installation and play time data
- Visual assets (images, backgrounds)

## Development Notes

- The launcher automatically detects if it's running in Tauri or web mode
- Windows-specific functionality is conditionally compiled for the target OS
- All Tauri commands include error handling and user feedback
- The UI adapts based on the runtime environment (web vs desktop)
